# Color Flipper
* It is a __color Flipper__ website.It changes _backgroundcolor of webpage_ when we click on a button.
* I had added only __11__ colors as background colors.So , I added an option that you can _add your color_ so that it was added to random colors list.
* I used __HTML , CSS__ and __JavaSript__ to build this webpage. 
* Following concepts are used to do this mini project
  * array
  * arrayName.length
  * document.getElementById
  * addEventListener
  * document.body.syle.backgroundColor
  * Math.random()
  * Math.floor()
